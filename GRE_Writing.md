# ARGUMENT

## Perspectives:

### 1.  Survey/Research/Investigation...

+ scope——may inquire merely the individuals <b>whose profits are closely related</b>(replaced by more concrete description: A survey about residents' attitudes towards waters sports -> the residents living upon the river)
+ sample capacity——only a small amount of people
+ setting of questions——people may choose A, but what's the other choices? Maybe B -- a more bad choice than A

### 2. Causal Not Valid

+ two phenomena in the article which the author thinks A caused——May other reasons rendering the results?

### 3. Measurement Not Effective

+ Conclusion in the article: Sb. should do …… to materialize some goals —— the measurement may not achieve that goal, should have more information

### 4. Time Changed

+ An object may experience some changes**(->more concrete description)** during a period of time

### 5. Situation Changed

example:

laboratory -> hospital

### 6. Conception Changed

example:

dog<->pet

serious infection<->infection



## Language

### Heading

+ Describe the thesis of the argument

> The main argument here is that adopting an honor code benefits Groveton students as the prevalence of cheating among them has successfully dwindled. Thus, the author recommends that all colleges and universities follow this paradigm.

+ Concession(state the good side of the author) + transition(not a cogent.../this argument is replete with holes and assumptions)+not strong enough to lead to ...
+ 

### Body para

#### Head Part: Describe the Assumption

+ **Doing.../With..., the author...(make some claim)**

```
Citing surveys of city residents, the author reports city resident's love of water sports.

Building upon the implication that residents do not use the river due to the quality of the river's water and the smell, the author suggests that a river clean up will result result in increased river usage.
```

+ **The author..., doing.../with.../because...**

```
Additionally, the author implies that residents do not use the river for swimming, boating, and fishing, despite their professed interest, because the water is polluted and smelly.
```

+ **The author... Thus, ... (use two sentences)**

The article points out that... By underscoring this, the author intends to hint...



#### Sample Part

+ **Concession + Transition:** First declare to some extent the assumption is right, then give some alternative cases.

> While a polluted, smelly river would likely cut down on river sports, a concrete connection between the resident's lack of river use and the river's current state is not effectively made. Though there have been complaints, we do not know if there have been numerous complaints from a wide range of people, or perhaps from one or two individuals who made numerous complaints.

+ **Subjunctive Mood:**

> 

+ **Declare the premises clearly:**

> For instance, Groveton College has 1000 students enrolled in exam, and this survey only covered 20 of them. Although more than 15 students reported a reduced cheating possibility, a good number of students unaccessible to this survey may hold opposite opinion, and the result ended up to be atypical. This sample size is too small to apply the result back to whole Groveton College, not to mention all universities.

+ clarify the total number of students->the number of students taking the survey->the two kinds of opinion the two groups of students may hold->explanation



> For example, <mark>during the last three years before the new honor code was in place</mark>, the number of cases of cheating for each year was 50, 30, and 10. Although the average number of cheating cases was 30, there emerged a clear downward trend of cheating and much lower than the cases of reported cheating <mark>in the first year of implementing new policy</mark>.

+ clarify the time during which some events are taking place

### Extra

+ **The interlaced use of long sentences and short sentences**

> For example, two decades ago, parents in Tertia might have limited job opportunities, which compelled them to work outside in order to make a living. <mark>This resulted in the prevalence of village-reared children.</mark> Nowadays, thanks to the emergence of the Internet, parents would have more chances to find a job related to online service, so that more parents are capable of taking care of their own kids.
