# ARGUMENT

## Perspectives:

### 1.  Survey/Research/Investigation...

+ scope——may inquire merely the individuals <b>whose profits are closely related</b>(replaced by more concrete description: A survey about residents' attitudes towards waters sports -> the residents living upon the river)
+ sample capacity——only a small amount of people
+ setting of questions——people may choose A, but what's the other choices? Maybe B -- a more bad choice than A
+ no other choice: some residents choose this option for other refuse/...
+ questions concerning this topic is too little: may the survey have 5 pages; only 2 questions cover the topic

### 2. Causal Not Valid

+ two phenomena in the article which the author thinks A caused——May other reasons rendering the results?

### 3. Measurement Not Effective

+ Conclusion in the article: Sb. should do …… to materialize some goals —— the measurement may not achieve that goal, should have more information

### 4. Time Changed

+ An object may experience some changes**(->more concrete description)** during a period of time
+ People's opinions/attitudes have changed

### 5. Situation Changed

example:

laboratory -> hospital

### 6. Conception Changed

example:

dog<->pet

serious infection<->infection

### 7. Number and Ratio

+ The article may emphasize the increase/decrease on the number, but in fact the ratio may not have this tendency.

## Language

### Heading

+ Describe the thesis of the argument

> The main argument here is that adopting an honor code benefits Groveton students as the prevalence of cheating among them has successfully dwindled. Thus, the author recommends that all colleges and universities follow this paradigm.

+ Concession(state the good side of the author) + transition(not a cogent.../this argument is replete with holes and assumptions)+not strong enough to lead to ...

#### How To Connect to the Instruction of the Question

1. Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

> Beyond these data, more specific evidence would, however, be still in great need in solidifying the projected result.

#### Extra Good Examples:

> The argument is well-presented, but not throughly well-reasoned.

### Body para

#### Head Part: Describe the Assumption

+ **Doing.../With..., the author...(make some claim)**

```
Citing surveys of city residents, the author reports city resident's love of water sports.

Building upon the implication that residents do not use the river due to the quality of the river's water and the smell, the author suggests that a river clean up will result result in increased river usage.
```

+ **The author..., doing.../with.../because...**

```
Additionally, the author implies that residents do not use the river for swimming, boating, and fishing, despite their professed interest, because the water is polluted and smelly.
```

+ **The author... Thus, ... (use two sentences)**

The article points out that... By underscoring this, the author intends to hint...

+ **Extra:** 

Remember to make clear who makes the argument(author?president?citizen?). Clarify it at the head part of a paragraph

#### Sample Part

+ **Concession + Transition:** First declare to some extent the assumption is right, then give some alternative cases.

> While a polluted, smelly river would likely cut down on river sports, a concrete connection between the resident's lack of river use and the river's current state is not effectively made. Though there have been complaints, we do not know if there have been numerous complaints from a wide range of people, or perhaps from one or two individuals who made numerous complaints.

+ **Subjunctive Mood:**

> 

+ **Declare the premises clearly:**

> For instance, Groveton College has 1000 students enrolled in exam, and this survey only covered 20 of them. Although more than 15 students reported a reduced cheating possibility, a good number of students unaccessible to this survey may hold opposite opinion, and the result ended up to be atypical. This sample size is too small to apply the result back to whole Groveton College, not to mention all universities.

->clarify the total number of students->the number of students taking the survey->the two kinds of opinion the two groups of students may hold->explanation

> For example, <mark>during the last three years before the new honor code was in place</mark>, the number of cases of cheating for each year was 50, 30, and 10. Although the average number of cheating cases was 30, there emerged a clear downward trend of cheating and much lower than the cases of reported cheating <mark>in the first year of implementing new policy</mark>.

->clarify the time during which some events are taking place



### Extra

+ **The interlaced use of long sentences and short sentences**

> For example, two decades ago, parents in Tertia might have limited job opportunities, which compelled them to work outside in order to make a living. <mark>This resulted in the prevalence of village-reared children.</mark> Nowadays, thanks to the emergence of the Internet, parents would have more chances to find a job related to online service, so that more parents are capable of taking care of their own kids.

## Template

### Describe an Argument

+ position, argument, recommendation

The main argument here is... 

Establishing on/Citing..., the author/article/speaker...

The author... By underscoring this, ...

The author points out that... Under the assumption/hypothesis that..., the author argues...

### Give a Counterexample

For example/For a counterexample, likely, ...

Supposedly, ...

In all likelihood/Possibly/Likely, ...

### Connect to the Requirement

1. **concession + transition**

While ... to some extent, ...

Partly cogent/reasonable as the claim is, ...(relate to the requirements of the question)

2. **With/Without**

With the questions not properly answered/ evidence not clearly proffered/ alternatives not cogently excluded/ assumption not so tenant, the author cannot bear out a conclusion logically.

3. **Subjunctive Mood**

Had it been the case/Had this hypothesis been true, the author could not draw a consequent so arbitrarily/cursorily.

### "Give a Conclusion"

+ valid, reasonable, persuasive, logical, cogent

The evidence the author cites, if the author does not answer the question clearly, will not serve to **solidify** the argument of the author.

Partly valid as the author proposes, the author cannot **conclude/assert/shore up/back up/solidify** his claim so **logically**.

With the questions unanswered, the author can not come to a fully **persuasive** conclusion.

..., the argument of the author cannot be so **persuasive** for the readers.

### Ending

+ **Question：**

While the author’s recommendation may be valid to some extent, there are a number of questions regarding his lines of reasoning that require further analysis. The argument could end up being pretty convincing or invalid in the end, depending on the answers to those questions.

While I fully understand the reasoning behind the argument, I withhold my approval of the recommendation until he/she can provide clear answers to the aforementioned questions.

+ **Evidence：**

l We need further proof to form a better evaluation of the argument. Only after weighing all of the evidence which serves to weaken the argument as well as those supporting the argument, can we come to a decision about the soundness of this argument.

+ **Assumption：**

If any of the assumptions mentioned raise doubt, the author's argument construction and conclusion will be questioned. Therefore, it is suggested that the author be able to take into account the above-mentioned assumptions, so that the final proposal can be more effective.

While the author’s conclusion appears appealing, the questionable assumptions discussed above may deprive it of its feasibility.

+ **Explanation (A=原文的解释，B=需要去解释的现象)：**

While A could lead to B, this could be due to other reasons, such as… Instead of jumping to the conclusion that B is solely based on A, the author could benefit by considering the other possible explanations above.

While A may plausibly account for B, I remain open to different explanations that also help to illustrate the facts presented in this argument. Unless the author offers clarification, I remain doubtful that his/her explanation is the only possibility.

### Argument Template

```
Refering to the evidence involving..., the author in the article argues that... Reasonable as the causality is to some extent, 
1. there remain some questions suspended to be answered to make the explanation more cogent.
2. more evidence is needed to further evaluate the lines of reasoning behind such a claim and the evidence would end up supporting or weakening the argument.
3. the conclusion of the author is based on several assumptions, which, if prove unwarranted, will seriously challenge the author’s conclusion.
4. without ruling out several alternative explanations, the conclusion could remain, at best, problematic.


Heading of the second paragraph: (正)
1. The first question involves...
2. The evidence involving... should be profferred to further strengthen the claim
3. The alternative may take place that...
4. The first assumption here is that...  


Citing..., the author concludes that... 
The author points out that... By underscoring this, the author intends to prove that...
With ... cited as evidence, the author augues that...


While the causality he proposes is partly correct, there remain some logical flaws, however. For a counterexample, ...
However, supposedly, ... 
Nevertheless, had ...(premise), ...(consequence). 


Had this been the case, the author could not had made his claims/hypothesis cogent.
Without 1.answering this question/2.excluding this alternative explanation/3.giving evidence entailing this/4.emphasizing such premises for his assumption, the author cannot assert his conclusion with great persuasiveness.
The author could hardly have concluded cogently if...
